# f450MultiWii

To use code, first upload clear EEPROM from Examples -> EEPROM -> CLEAR EEPROM
Then: 
  1) Set ARM conditions
  2) Calibrate ACC and MAG
  3) Change PID Values back to defaults for MAHOWII (Currently GPS and Hold values changed to Mahowii in code already)
  
Code uses HEX 6X for QuadX as replacement for broken digital port.
